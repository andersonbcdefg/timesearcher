<p>I finished on Wednesday, October 14, and started the previous Friday. Probably spent a couple of hours each of those days on average, so I would estimate the whole process took around 15 hours. As expected, drawing the lines was not the hard part, and the interaction was–especially the logic to draw and resize rectangles. I had to think about it for a while and incrementally add features (add a rectangle of fixed size; then let the user draw it; etc.). Deleting was pretty easy, and resizing was hard. I ended up doing it in by designating one corner as the one that can be dragged, which is intuitive enough and works pretty well.</p>
<p>I anticipated that filtering would be really hard, but once I figured out <em>conceptually</em> how to do it, the coding wasn’t so bad. Since D3 selections already have a <code>filter</code> method I just had to write the code to determine if a series passes through the box. One edge case is a box that is so narrow that it doesn’t actually contain any data (i.e. it is drawn <em>between</em> months). To handle this case, I wrote code to interpolate between the two nearest months. Finally, doing the extra credit only took a few minutes! Once all the filtering logic was there for time boxes, adding a filter for names was straightforward.</p>
<p>In completing this project, I found a couple of helpful code snippets that I should officially cite here. <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/larsenmtl/e3b8b7c2ca4787f77d78f58d41c3da91">This block</a> was a good example for drawing a line chart, though I also referred to Dae Hyun’s Observable notebook. And <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/michaelwooley/b095fa7ce0e11d771dcb3f035fda1f07">this block</a> was my starting point for drawing rectangles with the mouse, though of course I had to provide much more functionality than this basic example.</p>
